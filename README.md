<h1> CNN Architectures Implementation </h1>
This repository contains my implementation of several popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures from scratch, including AlexNet, VGG16, GoogleNet/Inception, MobileNet, ResNet, and U-Net. Each architecture is implemented layer by layer, providing a comprehensive understanding of their design and functionality.

<h1> Motivation</h1>
The motivation behind this project is to deepen my understanding of CNN architectures by implementing them from scratch. By dissecting and implementing these architectures layer by layer, I aim to gain insights into their inner workings, learn about different design choices, and explore their applications in various domains such as computer vision and image processing.

<h1> Implemented Architectures </h1>

 * **AlexNet**: A pioneering deep CNN architecture that significantly advanced the field of computer vision.
 * **VGG16**: Known for its simplicity and effectiveness, VGG16 is widely used in various image classification tasks.
 * **GoogleNet/Inception**: Introduces the concept of inception modules for efficient and scalable deep learning.
 * **MobileNet**: Optimized for mobile and embedded devices, MobileNet offers lightweight yet powerful feature extraction.
 * **ResNet**: With its residual connections, ResNet addresses the vanishing gradient problem and enables training of very deep networks.
 * **U-Net**: Designed for semantic segmentation tasks, U-Net features a contracting path followed by an expansive path for high-resolution output.

<h1> Usage </h1>
Each architecture implementation is provided in separate modules. Simply import the desired architecture module and instantiate the model to start using it. Detailed usage instructions and example scripts can be found in each module's documentation.
